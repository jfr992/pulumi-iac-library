# Pulumi POC with GitHub Actions

## Description

This Pulumi project sets up a network, an Application Load Balancer (ALB), and an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) using custom Pulumi [packages](https://github.com/jfr992/pulumi-packages). Check the architecture diagram below.

## Project Structure

- **Network**: Creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) along with public and private subnets.
- **ALB**: Creates an Application Load Balancer and a target group.
- **ASG**: Creates an Auto Scaling Group with instances that are registered to the target group.

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)

### Architecture of WebServer Deployment

## Configuration

The infrastructure configuration is managed through the `infra.yaml` file, and the user data script for the ASG instances is provided in the `userdata.sh` file.

### `infra.yaml`

```yaml
vpc:
  name: vpc
  cidr_block: <vpc-cidr>

subnets:
  - cidr_block: <public-cidr>
    az: us-east-1a
    public: true

  - cidr_block: <private-cidr>
    az: us-east-1a
    public: false

  - cidr_block: <private-cidr>
    az: us-east-1b
    public: false

alb:
  port: 80
  allowed_cidrs:
    - 0.0.0.0/0

asg:
  name: "some-name"
  ami-id: "ami-123"
  instance-type: "t2.micro"
  min-size: 1
  max-size: 1
  desired-capacity: 1
  ports:
    - 80
```

### Running the Project Locally

1. Log in to the AWS console and create an IAM user with enough privileges.
2. Gather the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and set them as environment variables:

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>"
```

3. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

4. Install dependencies:

```sh
go mod tidy
```

5. Deploy the infrastructure:

```sh
pulumi up
```

### Outputs

The following outputs will be exported:

- `vpcID`: The ID of the VPC created.
- `privateSubnetIds`: The IDs of the private subnets created.
- `publicSubnetIds`: The IDs of the public subnets created.
- `targetGroupArn`: The ARN of the target group created.
- `securityGroupID`: The ID of the security group created.

### GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions to preview the infrastructure changes on pull requests and updates the infrastructure when changes are merged. Check `pulumi-preview.yml` and `pulumi-up.yml`.
